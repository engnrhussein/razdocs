          <h2 className="font-heading text-2xl font-bold text-onyx mt-12 mb-4">1. Introduction and Scope</h2>
          <p>
            These Comprehensive Terms of Service ("Terms") govern your access to and use of the website, software, and transportation services provided by RAZ Transportation LLC (referred to herein as "Company," "we," "us," or "our"). These Terms apply to all visitors, shippers, receivers, freight brokers, owner-operators, and others who access or use the Services (collectively, "Users," "you," or "your").
          </p>

          <h2 className="font-heading text-2xl font-bold text-onyx mt-12 mb-4">2. Definitions</h2>
          <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2">
            <li><strong>"Bill of Lading" or "BOL"</strong> means the official shipping document issued by the Company, the shipper, or a third party acknowledging receipt of cargo for transit.</li>
            <li><strong>"Cargo" or "Freight"</strong> means the goods, property, or commodities tendered to the Company for transportation.</li>
            <li><strong>"Shipper"</strong> means the party tendering Cargo to the Company for transport.</li>
            <li><strong>"Accessorial Charges"</strong> means additional fees incurred beyond the standard line-haul rate, including but not limited to detention, layovers, lumpers, TONU (Truck Ordered Not Used), and redelivery fees.</li>
          </ul>

          <h2 className="font-heading text-2xl font-bold text-onyx mt-12 mb-4">3. Transportation Services and Conditions of Carriage</h2>
          <p>
            RAZ Transportation LLC operates as a licensed motor carrier operating under the authority of the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA) and the Department of Transportation (DOT). 
          </p>
          <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2">
            <li><strong>Right to Refuse Cargo:</strong> We reserve the right to inspect and refuse any Cargo that is deemed unsafe, improperly packaged, misclassified, or that violates any federal, state, or local laws (including prohibited hazardous materials).</li>
            <li><strong>Shipper Responsibilities:</strong> The Shipper is strictly responsible for providing accurate weight, dimensions, commodity descriptions, and proper packaging. The Company is not liable for damages resulting from the Shipper's failure to properly secure or package Cargo prior to transit.</li>
            <li><strong>Subcontracting:</strong> We reserve the right, at our sole discretion, to utilize affiliated independent contractors, owner-operators, or partner carriers to fulfill transportation contracts.</li>
          </ul>

          <h2 className="font-heading text-2xl font-bold text-onyx mt-12 mb-4">4. Bills of Lading (BOL) and Conflicting Terms</h2>
          <p>
            The Bill of Lading (BOL) serves as the primary receipt of goods and the contract of carriage. In the event of any conflict or inconsistency between the terms and conditions printed on a Shipper-provided BOL and these Terms of Service, <strong>these Terms of Service shall strictly prevail and govern</strong>, unless a separate, formally executed Master Transportation Agreement is signed by an authorized officer of RAZ Transportation LLC.
          </p>

          <h2 className="font-heading text-2xl font-bold text-onyx mt-12 mb-4">5. Rates, Quotes, and Payment Terms</h2>
          <p>
            All business conducted with RAZ Transportation LLC is subject to our financial and payment policies:
          </p>
          <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2">
            <li><strong>Quotes & Estimates:</strong> Rate quotes are valid for a specified period (typically 72 hours) and are based on the Shipper's declared specifications. Final invoicing will reflect actual weight, dimensions, and operational realities at the time of loading.</li>
            <li><strong>Accessorial Charges & Fuel Surcharges:</strong> You agree to pay all applicable accessorial charges incurred during transit. This includes standard industry fees for driver detention (waiting times exceeding 2 hours at origin/destination), layovers, tolls, lumpers, and variable fuel surcharges (FSC) linked to national diesel averages.</li>
            <li><strong>Payment Terms:</strong> Unless alternative credit terms are established in writing, all invoices are due Net 30 days from the date of the invoice. </li>
            <li><strong>Late Penalties & Factoring:</strong> Past due accounts will accrue interest at a rate of 1.5% per month (18% annually) or the maximum rate permitted by law, whichever is less. RAZ Transportation LLC utilizes freight factoring services; payments must be made directly to the assignee noted on the invoice. You are responsible for all legal and collection costs incurred to recover past due balances.</li>
          </ul>

          <h2 className="font-heading text-2xl font-bold text-onyx mt-12 mb-4">6. Cargo Liability and Claims (The Carmack Amendment)</h2>
          <p>
            Our liability for loss, damage, or delay to Cargo is strictly governed by the Carmack Amendment (49 U.S.C. § 14706).
          </p>
          <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2">
            <li><strong>Standard Liability Limitations:</strong> Unless a higher declared value is explicitly stated on the BOL prior to transit and a premium freight rate is paid, our maximum cargo liability is limited to <strong>$100,000 per shipment</strong>, or $2.50 per pound for used commodities, whichever is lesser.</li>
            <li><strong>Exclusions from Liability:</strong> We shall not be held liable for loss, damage, or delay caused by: (a) Acts of God or extreme weather; (b) the public enemy or acts of terrorism; (c) the authority of law (e.g., DOT inspections, customs holds); (d) the inherent vice or nature of the goods (e.g., spoilage without equipment failure); or (e) an act or default of the Shipper (e.g., improper loading or packaging).</li>
            <li><strong>Claims Processing:</strong> Any claim for cargo loss, damage, or shortage must be filed in writing with RAZ Transportation LLC within nine (9) months of the delivery date (or the date delivery should have occurred).
